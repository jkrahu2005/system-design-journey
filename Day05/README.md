# ðŸ“˜ Day 5 â€“ SOLID Principles: SRP, OCP, LSP

This folder contains C++ examples of 3 key SOLID principles:

---

## âœ… SRP â€“ Single Responsibility Principle

- A class should have only one reason to change.
- Promotes cleaner, modular code.

**Folder:** `Day05/srp/`  
**Example:** `srp_example.cpp`

---

## âœ… OCP â€“ Open/Closed Principle

- Software entities should be **open for extension**, but **closed for modification**.
- Encourages inheritance and abstraction.

**Folder:** `Day05/ocp/`  
**Example:** `ocp_example.cpp`

---

## âœ… LSP â€“ Liskov Substitution Principle

- Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types.
- Ensures correct behavior through inheritance.

**Folder:** `Day05/lsp/`  
**Example:** `lsp_example.cpp`

---

Each folder contains self-contained `.cpp` files demonstrating the principle in C++.
