# ðŸ“˜ Day 3 â€“ Polymorphism and Inheritance

In this session, I learned about:

---

## ðŸ”· Static Polymorphism (Compile-Time)

**Key Concepts:**
- Function Overloading
- Operator Overloading

**Advantages:**
- Faster execution
- Decisions made at compile-time

**Code:** `static_polymorphism.cpp`

---

## ðŸ”¶ Dynamic Polymorphism (Run-Time)

**Key Concepts:**
- Function Overriding
- Virtual Functions
- Base Class Pointer to Derived Class Object

**Advantages:**
- Runtime flexibility
- Enables interface-based design

**Code:** `dynamic_polymorphism.cpp`

---

## ðŸ§¬ Inheritance

**Key Concepts:**
- Code reusability
- Types: Single, Multiple, Multilevel, Hierarchical, Hybrid

**Code:** `inheritance.cpp`

---

## ðŸ“Ž Summary

Polymorphism allows the same interface to represent different data types, while inheritance enables code reuse and a hierarchical class structure. Both are essential in object-oriented design for building scalable systems.
